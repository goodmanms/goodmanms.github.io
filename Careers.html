            <h2>A Brief Overview</h2>
            <p> Aerospace engineers perform engineering duties in designing, constructing, and testing aircraft, and spacecraft. May conduct basic and applied research to evaluate adaptability of materials and equipment to aircraft design and manufacture. May recommend improvements in testing equipment and techniques.</p>

          <h1>Careers in Aerospace and Aeronautics</h1>
          <p>Our Destination is Mars. But to get there, we cant do it alone. Masters in software, hardware, structural, and propulsion engineering, as well as professionals in launch and test will be required to make the journey to Mars. Generally, aerospace engineers design aircraft, spacecraft, satellites, and missiles. In addition, they test prototypes to make sure that they function according to design. While there may only be a few astronauts on the spaceship, the team is takes to get those astronauts to the red planet will take many hard working and dedicated individuals. Each has a specific role that will greatly contribute to colonization of Mars. This page is here to inform you of the most necessary jobs required to reach our final destination: the Red Planet.</p>

	        <h2>Software Engineering</h2>
            <p>Software engineers apply the principles of software engineering to the design, development, maintenance, testing, and evaluation of computer software and systems. Some of the jobs that must be performed include creating code that autonomously pilots our vehicles in space, simulates countless flight scenarios, translates petabytes of data, and performs computational fluid dynamics.</p>

            <div class="content_container">
		      <h2>Hardware Engineering</h2>
              <p>Computer hardware engineers research, design, develop, and test computer systems along with components such as processors, circuit boards, memory devices, networks, and routers. These engineers discover new directions in computer hardware, which generate rapid advances in computer technology. Nearly every board and box that controls, communicates, animates, or powers our avionics is created by a Harware Engineer and built in-house employing the same iterative approach used in the commercial industries.</p>

		    <div class="content_container">
		      <h2>Structures Engineering</h2>
              <p> Structural Engineers design only the most  mass-efficient primary and secondary structures possible while exceeding all factors of safety. A specialty within the field of civil engineering focuses on the framework of structures, it also focuses on designing those structures to withstand the stresses and pressures of their environment and remain safe, stable, and secure throughout their use.</p>

		    <div class="content_container">
		      <h2>Propulsion Engineering</h2>
              <p>The job of a Propulsion Engineer falls under the broader career category of Aerospace Engineers, who conduct basic and applied research to evaluate the adaptability of materials and equipment to design and manufacture aircraft. Propulsion Engineers formulate mathematical models or other methods of computer analysis to develop, evaluate, or modify design according to customer engineering requirements.</p>          
              <div class="content_container">
		      <h2>Launch and Test</h2>
		      <p> Launch and test Aerospace Engineers are mostly self explanatory, they launch and test rockets, planes, missiles, spacecrafts, and more. They direct or coordinate activities of engineering or technical personnel involved in designing, fabricating, modifying, and testing of aircraft or aerospace products. They also evaluate product data or design from inspections or reports for conformance to engineering principles, customer requirements, environmental regulations, or quality standards.</p>
