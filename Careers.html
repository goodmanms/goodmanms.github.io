            <h2>A Brief Overview</h2>
            <p> Aerospace engineers perform engineering duties in designing, constructing, and testing aircraft, and spacecraft. May conduct basic and applied research to evaluate adaptability of materials and equipment to aircraft design and manufacture. May recommend improvements in testing equipment and techniques.</p>

          <h1>Careers in Aerospace and Aeronautics</h1>
          <p>Our Destination is Mars. But to get there, you cant do it alone. Masters in software, hardware, structures, and propulsion engineering, as well as professionals in launch and test will be required to make the journey to Mars. Generally, aerospace engineers primarily design aircraft, spacecraft, satellites, and missiles. In addition, they test prototypes to make sure that they function according to design. While there may only be a few astronauts on the spaceship, the team is takes to get those astronauts to the red planet will take many hard working and dedicated individuals, each with a specific role that will greatly contribute to colonization of Mars. This page is here to inform you of the most necessary jobs required to reach our final destination, the Red Planet.</p>

	        <h2>Software Engineering</h2>
            <p>Software engineersapply the principles of software engineering to the design, development, maintenance, testing, and evaluation of the software and systems that make computers or anything containing software work. Some of the jobs that must be performed are creating code that autonomously pilots our vehicles in space, simulates countless flight scenarios, translates petabytes of data, performs computational fluid dynamics, and more.</p>

		      <h2>Hardware Engineering</h2>
              <p>Computer hardware engineersresearch, design, develop, and test computer systems and components such as processors, circuit boards, memory devices, networks, and routers. These engineersdiscover new directions in computerhardware, which generate rapid advances in computer technology. Nearly every board and box that controls, communicates, actuates, or powers our avionics is built in-house employing the same iterative approach used in the commercial industries, will be created by a Hardware Engineer.</p>

		      <h2>Structures Engineering</h2>
              <p>Only the most  mass-efficient primary and secondary structures possible while exceeding all factors of safety. a specialty within the field of civil engineering focuses on the framework ofstructures, and on designing thosestructures>to withstand the stresses and pressures of their environment and remain safe, stable and secure throughout their use.</p>

		      <h2>Propulsion Engineering</h2>
              <p>A job as a Propulsion Engineer falls under the broader career category of Aerospace Engineers, who conduct basic and applied research to evaluate the adaptability of materials and equipment to aircraft design and manufacture. They formulate mathematical models or other methods of computer analysis to develop, evaluate, or modify design, according to customer engineering requirements.</p>          
              <div class="content_container">
		      <h2>Launch and Test</h2>
		      <p> Launch and test Aerospace engineers are mostly self explanitory, they launch and test rockets, planes, missiles, spacecrafts, etc. Direct or coordinate activities of engineering or technical personnel involved in designing, fabricating, modifying, or testing of aircraft or aerospace products.Evaluate product data or design from inspections or reports for conformance to engineering principles, customer requirements, environmental regulations, or quality standards.</p>
