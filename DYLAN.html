          <h1>Types of vehicles</h1>
          <p>The two most common types of vehicles in space travel are rockets and rovers. Rockets are used to travel to the destination while rovers are used for exploration at the the moon or planet. Both are very important components for sucessful missions in space. </p>
          <div class="content_container">
            <h2>Past and Current Rockets</h2>
            <p>A famous saying is, 'it's not rocket science' This saying correctly entails that rocket science is an extremely difficult science. The difference of rockets of today and past rockets display that difficulty. What has been accomplished is tremendous. The first rocket launched in July of 1950 and it was used for testing in the upper atmosphere. Skip some years into the present day and there is the U.S. Space Shuttle. The Space Shuttle completed several successful missions. However, not all space travel is with the government. On Sunday, February 19 at 9:39:00 a.m. EST, SpaceX launched the Falcon 9 rocket carrying the Dragon cargo spacecraft. The Falcon 9 rocket was designed to return astronauts to space and thus it was designed for reliability. An astonishing event took place after the launch when the 1st stage returned and landed upright on a platform, rather than dropping into the ocean as the standard procedure. </p>

              <h2>Past and Current Rovers</h2>
              <p>The last rover on the moon was the Lunar Roving Vehicle or the LRV. This rover was used in the apollo 15, 16 and 17 missions. This rover got power from two silver-zinc potassium hydroxide batteries coupled to four electric motors, one on each wheel that combine to create one horsepower. One isn't that much but with the low gravity of the moon it suffices. The Curiosity rover was the last rover to arrive on Mars. The purpose of Curiosity was to take pictures of Mars and perform experiments on rocks. This rover is about the size of a car and can travel around at a speed of 660 ft per day. The main purpose was to discover if Mars could support life. With clever people and amazing technology, we learned a lot about Mars.</p>

        <h1>Future Designs and Concepts</h1>
		       <h2>Future Rockets</h2>
		       <p>The future rocket designs contain even more amazing technology. A company that has absolutely astonishing design rockets is SpaceX. SpaceX has an amazing rocket that provides a ridiculous, record-breaking 5,130,000 lbf of lift. This rocket is designed for reliability so as to fulfill the purpose of this rocket: to keep human in space. Falcon heavy will supposedly lift off this year, possibly carrying the first commercial spaceflight. Another future rocket is NASA’s Orion. Orion is a new concept rocket meant to put astronauts farther into space. NASA plans to venture farther into deep space. This rocket is built particularly to sustaining the crew through the lengthy journey. This will use a new heavy lift to provide maximum thrust for a successful mission. With tons of research and testing, this rocket will travel farther into space than we have ever gone.</p>

        <h2>Future Rovers</h2>
		        <p>Set to launch in the summer of 2020, NASA’s concept rover will use many of the instruments from the curiosity rover and new instruments for new experiments. This rover will collect important data to tell us about Mars’ past. NASA is planning on bringing some of the rocks collected by this rover back to earth for testing. There are rumors of the rover being nuclear-powered, however, more information will be released about this rover later on. There has even been talks at Audi of all companies about concept development for a Lunar rover. These companies are still in development for their groundbreaking projects and will also release more information later down the line. </p>
